\section*{Why this book}

\section*{Brief history of book}

DJM visited DS in Boston for almost all of 2020. Mutual excitement over different but related things. DS super excited about $\poly$, DJM super excited about doctrines and later paradigms.

DJM encodes something like Poly in Idris and teaches Idris to DS, who having just learned Haskell (thanks Bartosz!) quickly ports the ideas to the strict $\poly$ setting. We discussed writing a book together---a $T$-shape, consisting of a broad generalization with paradigms and a deep dive into $\poly$---after ACT2020, in July.

DS realized comonoids were important to the story. Joachim reminded DS that Richard Garner talked about cofree comonoids at a recent CT. Richard's HottEST talk was completely mind blowing for DS. Worlds collided.

Nelson joins David as undergraduate student researcher and very quickly taught David lots of cool stuff about comonoids and bimodules. Great synergy there. 

DS invented poly boxes, and everything started going faster---very fast-paced and relevant research while writing a book is not so good, so it got disjointed. The writing was going quickly, if not particularly coherent, but began to falter in mid-August when DS's hands began to hurt and DJM's teaching duties started. The pace crawled. 

DS personally hired Nelson as a typist. Nelson had been so helpful earlier, DS asks DJM if NN can be an author. DJM and DS realize the book would be better as two, DS peels off his part. 

DS asked NN if he was willing to join in the effort to make a quality product, and he was. They started in Jan 2021.
